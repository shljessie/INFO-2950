## Dataset Ideas:  Google QuickDraw Dataset Analyzing Human Drawing Patterns

### Idea 1
https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset 

#### Project Idea
Using the Google Quickdraw Dataset to explore the different
variations of people's drawings. Stereotypes, culture influences,
cognitive processes of human drawing can be studied. I could analyze the
data and choose a certain drawing or a category of drawing to analyze the 
variations of drawings between people from different countries. 

#### About the DataSet
The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw!. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located. You can browse the recognized drawings on https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data 
The data contains of the keyid, category of drawing, whether it was recognized by the game, country code, and strokes used in the drawing. 



### Idea 2 : Spotify - What songs are replayed the most

One project I could do is to classify spotify users by
different tastes in music and see what correlation there is between
different spotify users in 


#### About the DataSet
Using the Spotify Web API and Beautiful Soup, I can webscrape 
data from Spotify to use for my project. I can get data such as 
Artist, Album, Genre, ...etc


### Idea 3 : Podcast Analysis 

https://podcastindustryinsights.com/api/

After conducting a data exploratory analysis of people 
listening to podcasts, I could predict what podcasts are more 
popular to certain age groups, genders, backgrounds and single out a few factors that 
I belive could be indicative of popular podcasts for a certain group.

#### About the DataSet
This is a API that helps people webscrape data from podcast industries based
on different platforms and offers a detailed dataset for Apple Podcasts.
I can get data about different category podcasts, the number of episodes, number of
people listening to podcasts for each episode.
