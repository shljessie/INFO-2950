## Dataset Ideas

### Idea 1
https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset 

#### Project Idea
Using the Google Quickdraw Dataset to explore the different
variations of people's drawings. Stereotypes, culture influences,
cognitive processes of human drawing can be studied. I could analyze the
data and choose a certain drawing or a category of drawing to analyze the 
variations of drawings between people from different countries. 

#### About the DataSet
The Quick Draw Dataset is a collection of 50 million drawings across 345 categories, contributed by players of the game Quick, Draw!. The drawings were captured as timestamped vectors, tagged with metadata including what the player was asked to draw and in which country the player was located. You can browse the recognized drawings on <quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data>
The data contains of the keyid, category of drawing, whether it was recognized by the game, country code, and strokes used in the drawing. 



### Idea 2

Tracking animal data 

Reddit has a *very* comprehensive API that makes it relatively easy to extract
big datasets. We could build a dataset from that API without too much trouble
and predict, for example, how many upvotes a post gets or something...maybe we
could find a domain-appropriate complement dataset to cross-compare.
