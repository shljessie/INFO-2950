    "#### 1. Context of Work\n",
    "\n",
    "Bike Sharing comes with many benefits such as providing free or affordable access to bicycles for short-distance trips. By doing so in an urban area, this reduces congestion, noise, and air pollution. \n",
    "\n",
    "However whether or not these bike sharing systems are truly accessible for all is questionable. Since the accessibility of these bike sharing systems depend heavily on where the stations are located, it is very likely that where you live becomes the deciding factor in whether or not you will be able to use these bikes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In coming up with our research question, we looked at many research papers on bike sharing system equity. \n",
    "For example, a [study done by Portland State University](https://trec.pdx.edu/research/project/884) suggests that significant portions of the population are underrepresented among bike share users, including people of color, along with lower-income, female, older adults and less-educated groups. An [article in 2017](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2017/07/05/whats-keeping-people-from-using-bike-share-new-study-breaks-it-down-by-race-and-income/) finds that this may be due to the fact that these low-income communities and people of color view traffic risk, high prices, and the potential for crime and harassment as the biggest barriers to bicycling and using bike-share in their neighborhoods. There has also been [data visualization research at MIT](https://aberke.github.io/income-race-bikes/) about how bikes are being distributed in NYC throughout the years in accordance to race&income.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we look into how citibike stations are distributed in NYC and how that relates to the following factors: 1) race&income and  2) citibike usage. Are there more stations in areas of higher usage regardless of race and income? Does race and income seem to have an unignorable correlation with how citibike stations are being distributed? How much of these factors play into the distribution of citibike? How might citibike station distribution be improved? These are the questions we will ask and attempt to answer throughout this project.\n",
    " \n",
    "We are specificially looking at **NYC citibike trip data in 2017 as a sample** of the representation of NYC bike stations around New York. We chose New York City's citibike system since New York City is an area where there are widely varying levels of income. We chose 2017 for two reasons,    1) NYC's race and income data was avaiable for the years 2013 -2018 and 2) 2017 was a year when many new stations of citibike where added to represent its overall usage.\n",
    "We decided that 2017 would be a fair representation of how citibike stations were distributed throughout NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Research Question\n",

    "##### How inclusive / representative is Citi Bike of New York City Demographics? \n",

    "##### 2. Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was created to help developers, engineers, statisticians, artists, academics and the local public to explore the usage of citi bike around New York City. Insights from these findings would help citibike officials find answers to questions like where citibike users ride, how far they go,and what stations are the most popular.  It is an open dataset on the public bike sharing system of New York City. It is open to the public to help people find insights about this system.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This citibike data was funded by citibike in New York. Lyft is the operator of the Citi Bike program in New York City and Jersey City. The raw dataset was collected from this source https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Trips that may have been taken by staff who are managing citibike throughout the city are not good representations of citibikes trips by users only. Bikes may have been relocated overnight so that the distribution of bikes around the city are evenly distributed. Also bikes that may have been broken may lead to a loss of data.  Also citibike usage trip data is not a complete representation of all bike rider data in New York. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "In signing up for using citibike, these users are allowing for citibike to take data of their usage. \n",
    "Citibike releases information about the userâ€™s ride and trip duration  including their start station, usertype(Subscriber, one time user), gender, and year of birth. Citibike plans on using this data to understand citi bike users and the overall trend of citi bike users in new york city. Though many citibike users might not have been aware of this, they could have assumed that the data was collected to understand the citibike users for business related reasons.\n",

    "##### 1. What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in this data set corresponds to a unique Citi Bike station in NYC. \n",
    "The following is the meaning of each column in this data set: \n",
    "- Station_id: integer that uniquely identifies a station \n",
    "- Station_name: name of the station \n",
    "- Lat: latitude of the station \n",
    "- Long: longitude of the station \n",
    "- First_trip: Date of the first trip ever taken from the station \n",
    "- Last_trip: Data of the last trip taken from the station (at the time this data was downloaded) \n",
    "- Rides: total number of rides taken from the station \n",
    "- Geoid: geographical identifier for the NYC census tract that the station is located in \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "\n",
    "The base dataset for this table came from the same source as the Citbike trip data set described above. However, more processing was done to this data to obtain this station dataset by a team of MIT researchers who were trying to map out the locations of Citi Bike stations in NYC for their research purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This table uses as its base table the Cibike trip data set that was funded by citibike in New York. However, the processing that was done to this raw citi bike data was done by MIT researchers, so it can be assumed that MIT indirectly funded the creation of this Citibike trip data set. MIT Media Lab research: https://github.com/aberke/income-race-bikes/tree/master/data/nyc-bike\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the station data to the current form, we first used an API to obtain the geoid (unique census tract identification number) from the longitude and latitude of each Citibike station. This data was then added as the â€˜Geoidâ€™ column in the data set. Next since our project focuses on 2017, I removed all stations that had its first trip after 2017 since they are not relevant to our analysis. Lastly, I renamed a few columns to make their names more intuitive. Such as renaming â€˜idâ€™ to â€˜station_idâ€™ and â€˜nameâ€™ to â€˜station_nameâ€™. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this data set is derived from the citi bike trips dataset, citi bike users were made aware that citibike would be tracking their usage data, when users signed up for the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expected usage of this data is the same as for the Citi Bike trip data above. \n",

    "\n",
    "##### 2. Why was this dataset created?\n",
    "This dataset was created in order to study the census tract data along with the associated race and income in that tract from 2017. This was done by extracting the household median income and household race from the American Community Survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Who funded the creation of the dataset?\n",
    "This data was created and funded by the United States Census bureau. The creation of this dataset was funded by the MIT Media Lab.

    "\n",
    "##### 4. What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?\n",
    "The American Community Surveyâ€™s data collection process is performed by randomly selecting 3.5 million addresses to reply to the survey in order to represent the entire population. Because this survey is limited to those with addresses, there may be households and individuals who are not recorded in the census. For example, the homeless population is difficult to track and therefore could influence the data as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?\n",
    "Because the original data from the American Community Survey was downloaded as a shapefile, the data had to be extracted and transformed into a dataframe. After extracting the race, income, and renaming the columns, the data set was created. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, rows where the median income was not a numeric integer were dropped except for rows that contain the value â€˜$250,000+â€™ as their median income which were changed to â€˜250,000â€™ so that they can be treated as numeric values. Next only the 2017, income and race columns were selected since our project focuses on 2017.\n",
