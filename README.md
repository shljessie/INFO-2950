1. Context of WorkÂ¶
Bike Sharing comes with many benefits such as providing free or affordable access to bicycles for short-distance trips. By doing so in an urban area, this reduces congestion, noise, and air pollution.

However whether or not these bike sharing systems are truly accessible for all is questionable. Since the accessibility of these bike sharing systems depend heavily on where the stations are located, it is very likely that where you live becomes the deciding factor in whether or not you will be able to use these bikes. In addition to this, other factors such as the condition of roads and price of usage may be factors that prohibit people from actively using citibikes.

In coming up with our research question, we looked at many research papers on bike sharing system equity. For example, a study done by Portland State University suggests that significant portions of the population are underrepresented among bike share users, including people of color, along with lower-income, female, older adults and less-educated groups. An article in 2017 finds that this may be due to the fact that these low-income communities and people of color view traffic risk, high prices, and the potential for crime and harassment as the biggest barriers to bicycling and using bike-share in their neighborhoods. There has also been data visualization research at MIT about how bikes are being distributed in NYC throughout the years in accordance to race&income.

In this project, we are looking closer into how these findings on bike sharing this applies to New York City. We have chosen to look at citibike. In this project, we look into how citibike stations are distributed in NYC and how that relates to the following factors: 1) race&income and 2) citibike usage. Are there more stations in areas of higher usage regardless of race and income? Does race and income seem to have an unignorable correlation with how citibike stations are being distributed? How much of these factors play into the distribution of citibike? How might citibike station distribution be improved? These are the questions we will ask and attempt to answer throughout this project.

Through gaining insight on how citibike stations are distributed in NYC, we will attempt to gain insight into what NYC can do to improve the distribution of citibike to reflect the race/income and usage demographics.

2. Research Question
How is citibike representing NYC demographics? (in 2017).

Here NYC demographics will refer to Race&Income of NYC and the usages of citibike trips.

On the other hand, citibike representation will refer to the the distribution of stations and distribution of usage.

3. Project Design + Limitations
We are specificially looking at NYC citibike trip data in 2017 as a sample of the representation of NYC bike stations around New York. We chose New York City's citibike system since New York City is an area where there are widely varying levels of income. We chose 2017 for two reasons, 1) NYC's race and income data was available for the years 2013 -2018 and 2) 2017 was a year when many new stations of citibike where added to represent its overall usage. We decided that 2017 would be a fair representation of how citibike stations were distributed throughout NYC.

We chose geoid as our standard for breaking up NYC into different geographical areas, since a geoid is the unique indentifier for a census tract, and a census tract is the smallest geographic region which the US goverment collects race and income data on during its annual Census. A census tract is roughly equivealnt to a neighborhood, and they generally encompass a population between 2500 to 8000 people. This link has more information on geoids and the visual size of them on a map.

4. Main Findings
We found that as of 2017, Citibike has primarily placed bike stations in areas that are predominantly white and wealthy. In doing so, Citibike has neglected to account for the needs of predominantly asian and black neighborhoods in NYC.

5. Summary of Results
We found that census tracts with a high number of stations actually had a lower number of trips.
We found that white and high income areas had a high number of stations
We found that white areas have a high number of stations to meet demand
We found that asian and black neighborhoods do not have enough stations to meet their current demand.
